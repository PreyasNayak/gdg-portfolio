# GDG Portfolio Workshop - Starter Template 🚀

Welcome to the GDG Portfolio Building Workshop! This repository contains the starter code for building your personal portfolio website using React and Vite.


## 🛠️ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

### 1. Install Dependencies

Open your terminal in the project folder and run:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run the Development Server

Start the local development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

After running the command, you should see a URL in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`). Open this URL in your browser to see your app.
